# ANN-customer-churn-prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. It utilizes the **Churn_Modelling.csv** dataset to train the model and a Streamlit application for user interaction and predictions.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, impacting profitability and growth. This project predicts the likelihood of customers leaving a service based on their characteristics, allowing businesses to implement targeted retention strategies.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moaoutir/ANN-customer-churn-prediction.git
cd customer-churn-prediction
python -m venv venv             # Create a virtual environment named 'venv'
source venv/bin/activate        # Activate the virtual environment (use 'venv\Scripts\activate' on Windows)
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## Run the Streamlit Application:

Launch the application using the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501 to interact with the app.
